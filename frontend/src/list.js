	description: "React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM."

	description: "Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries."

	description: "Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript web framework, based on the Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework.Ember is used on many popular websites, including Discourse, Groupon, LinkedIn, Vine, Live Nation, Nordstrom, Twitch.tv, and Chipotle. Although primarily considered a framework for the web, it is also possible to build desktop and mobile applications in Ember. The most notable example of an Ember desktop application is Apple Music, a feature of the iTunes desktop application. The Ember trademark is owned by Tilde Inc."

	description: "Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server[citation needed], meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend component of the MEAN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and AngularJS frontend framework."

	description: "Nuxt.js is a free and open source web application framework based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. The framework is advertised as meta-framework for universal applications. The term universal is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to enable users to create web views in JavaScript utilizing familiar Vue.js single file component system, that can function both as in-browser single page application (SPA) views, as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) rehydrated to full SPA functionality. Additionally, the framework enables users to have the content, or parts of it, fully pre-rendered on the server and served in the manner of static site generators."

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools."
